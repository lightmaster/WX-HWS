           [[[DAILYCHARTS]]]
                encoding = strict_ascii	
                template = wxchartdata/DDMMYYYY.csv.tmpl
                HTML_ROOT = /var/www/pws/wxcharts

    # Charts that plot "by month"
            [[[MONTHLYCHARTS]]]
                encoding = strict_ascii
                template = wxchartdata/MMYYYY.csv.tmpl
                HTML_ROOT = /var/www/pws/wxcharts

    # Charts that plot "by year"
            [[[YEARLYCHARTS]]]
                encoding = strict_ascii
                template = wxchartdata/YYYY.csv.tmpl
                HTML_ROOT = /var/www/pws/wxcharts
                
    
    [[WXSTATS]]
    
    # Generates data for various W34 Statistics
            [[[W34STATS]]]
                 encoding = strict_ascii
                 template = w34stats.php.tmpl
                 HTML_ROOT = /var/www/pws

* In the download you will find a folder called 'copy_folder_and_file_inside_to_skins_Standard or Seasons_folder'. Inside is a folder called 'wxchartdata' and a file called w34stats.php.tmpl. Move  or copy both of these to your skins/Standard (or Seasons) folder.
* You will also find a folder called 'copy_files_inside_to_user_folder'. Copy the files inside stats.py and lastrain.py into your weewx/bin/user folder.

# IMPORTANT

* Once complete and everyting is saved, please restart weeWX.
